            Overall our trip was superb. Special thanks to Ms. Dolly who addressed this issue sincerely.A tip for other travellers: keem some IDR along with USD as most places accept IDRKintamani and Lake Batur trip and lunch at Sari Restaurant facing Mt. Batur was one of the best moments. Also the temple tours - Uluwatu, Mengwi, Tanah Lot, Tirta Empul were excellent. The friendly guides of supplier made the trip very good. Kecak dance is one of the highlights not to be missed. The coffee plantations having 12 types of tea and coffee are another experience worth having. Both Fave hotel and Bali dream Villa very good hotels.Tips: Temple trips of Mengwi, Alaskedaton and Tanah Lot should be started a bit earlier keeping in mind Bali traffic so that all the temples are covered in time.

            Hello there,So I went to Mauritius for my honeymoon from 14th May 2017 to 20th May 2017. First of all I was pretty reluctant to choose travel triangle over other renowned travel agents like make my trip and Thomas Cook. But as soon as I posted my willingness to go to Mauritius I was flooded with quoted from different travel agents and I opted travel trails and the person I was talking to was Ms. Dolly. She was quite helpful and was gracious enough to answer all my silly queries.After finalising the travel agent I had to opt for my resort and other intricate details which proved to be more useful than I thought they would be. 14th May arrived and we went to mairitis and was picked by the tour guides by the name supercool/island walk. They transferred us to our hotel Long Beach resort and spa. This place needs a special mention. Trust me I have travelled to several countries but this country and this resort is breath taking. I would ask you guys to recommend every couple to stay at this resort. The staff and nd the facilities are very pleasant.Having said that the supercool or island walk people weren't as good as I or any other Co traveller would expect. There drivers and tour guides were blatantly rude to the travellers and there came a point when we were afraid of asking them of anything.Anyhow our trip other than this hiccup was quite nice and I would like to specially thank  Dolly from travel trail for helping us and being so nice.Signing off.The resort I stayed in.

            The trip was well planned by Online Travel Trail. Time to time follow up by the team Dolly.All documents related to trip were sent on time. The on-arrival details were mentioned clearly in the vouchers.The tour operator of Mauritius (Island Walk - InTune Travels) was really good. The trips were organised well by them and they helped us plan the other adhoc activites very well with prompt responses.We stayed in The Ravanela Attitude for the entire trip. The hotel and its interior is good but we were disappointed by their service. They didn't change our room even after repeated requests. Except for the hotel service, everything else was good in the trip.Suggestions to other travellers:Activities: The water sports at Ile Aux Cerfs island were really good and worth for money. Do try the under seawalk, tube ride, parasailing and speed boat. We also went for the Blue Safari Submarine and it was a wonderful experience, if you wish to see the underwater life. The Casela Nature Park is also good and should be visited if you are going to Mauritius.Hotel: The Ravanela Attitude is a good place to stay but is completely in the outskirts and hence you can't go anywhere without a vehicle. Try picking a hotel somewhere near to the main city, so that the transportation would become easier. And if you plan to stay in 'The Ravanela Attitude' then make sure you request for a room near to the reception at the time of booking itself else you may end up getting a room which is at 10 mins walking distance from the main hotel lobby/reception. Drinking Water: Most of the hotels in Mauritius provide 1 ltr water bottle per day. If you need more, then you may have to purchase it at extra cost. Purchase water bottles from local shops in Mauritius as you would get it much cheaper there than the hotel.Personal Care: Make sure you carry a good sunscreen and apply it diligently before stepping out from your hotel room. Carry the sunscreen with you and keep applying it every 3-4 hours else you may end up tanning yourself very badly.Food: Our hotel served both veg and non-veg food but it is advised to carry some packaged food with you which you can carry during your sight-seeing and use it in case you don't like the taste of food at the hotel.

            It was indeed a wonderful trip.We all had a great time. Right from visa to booking of air tickets and the passes for Universal studio , Sentosa , vouchers for cruise etc was managed very well. The best part was trip was seamless pick-up -drop during the whole trip. Ms. Fazirah was so helpful. Even if we missed the pick-up , she arranged another one within no time. Coordination by Ms. Fazirah was amazingly. The Hotel room and the cruise were really good. The best part of the Hotel in Singapore was that it was close to Little India , so we had no issues as far as food was concerned. The Star Cruise room was good, every Resturants in Cruise had Indian cusines. Thanks to Madam Dolly and her team of Online Travel Trail to organize a wonderful trip. Very well planned.

        Complete trip was coordinated and arranged in an excellent manner. Travel guide were also very friendly and knowledgeable. Both the hotel and villa were awesome. Bali is a awesome place. We did not felt boring for even a single day.In whole trip, arrangement for the candle night dinner was very disappointing although food was good. Arrangement was not as per the discussion and commitment. In my itinerary wine was included but was served to us on chargeable basis and online travel trails did not even bear the complete cost of wine.Suggestion to travelers : Do not give arrangement of candle night dinner in agents scope. Its better to ask hotel or villa to arrange. They will charge you bit more but you will get what is assured. Rest I appreciate online travel trails for arranging all the hotels that has been agreed and we did not felt any problem in terms of food (vegetarian) and sight-seeing.

They helped me in customisation and made the tour as per my budget and need. The hotel and villa were very good. Online travel trail and travel triangle both were available on call all the time. They were very helpful. They made our honeymoon trip very memorable.
